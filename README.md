# Simple ATM Simulation in Python

This is a simple command-line ATM program written in Python. It allows a user to:

- Log in with a PIN
- Check their balance
- Deposit money
- Withdraw money
- Exit the system

## Features

- Input validation for PIN and transactions
- Balance tracking
- Error handling for invalid inputs

## Usage

1. Run the script using Python 3:
    ```bash
    python atm.py
    ```
2. Enter the correct PIN (`1234`) to access the system.
3. Follow on-screen instructions to check balance, deposit, withdraw or exit.

## Example

```bash
Please enter your pin: 1234
Withdraw, deposit, balance or exit? balance
Your balance is: 1000
Withdraw, deposit, balance or exit? withdraw
How much do you want to withdraw? 200
